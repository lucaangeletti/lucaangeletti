# Luca Angeletti
I am a product oriented Software Engineer with 17 years of experience. Worked on 18 iOS, macOS, and watchOS projects (even featured in some Apple Keynotes) leveraging UIKit and SwiftUI.
Coded in Swift for 9 years and Objective-C for 15 years.

My software development background includes several paradigms (OOP, POP, Imperative, Declarative, Functional, Reactive, Parallel, Concurrent), patterns (MVC, MVP, VIPER, MVVM, Unidirectional Data Flow), and languages (Swift, Objective-C, Java, SQL, C, GLSL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS).

In 2013, I invested a year in building Luminetic Land: my videogame for iPhone and iPad written in Objective-C that leverages Box2D (a physics engine), Cocos2D, OpenGL, and the Ray casting technique to deliver accurate real-time lighting effects. It got featured on AppStore Portugal.

Contributed to StackOverflow for 11 years. Wrote 997 answers on Swift, iOS, and SpriteKit, that reached 2.9 million users, earning me a reputation of 59k and a ranking in the top 0.35%.

Since 2017, I have been working remotely with European companies (leveraging GitHub, Slack, Jira and Figma) where I had the opportunity to improve my communication, teamwork, leadership, and problem solving skills.

Published 11 articles about Swift, Codable, and JSON on Medium.
Taught app development in classroom, via Skype, and on Codementor (with a 5-star reputation).
Written 245 tutorials in Italian covering topics such as Swift and Objective-C.

Experienced with a variety of organizations: small startups, big corporates, product companies, and app agencies.

In my free time I enjoy running, training my Wing Chun, playing Chess, and reading.
