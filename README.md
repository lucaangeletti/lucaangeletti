# Luca Angeletti
I am a product oriented Software Engineer with 17 years of total experience. Worked on 16 different iOS, macOS, and watchOS projects (even featured in some Apple Keynotes).
Used Swift for 9 years and Objective-C for 15 years.

üñ•Ô∏è My software development background includes several paradigms (OOP, POP, Imperative, Declarative, Functional, Parallel, Concurrent), patterns (MVC, MVP, VIPER, MVVM, Unidirectional Data Flow), and languages (Java, SQL, C, GLSL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS).

üïπÔ∏è In 2013, I invested a year in building Luminetic Land: my videogame for iPhone and iPad written in Objective-C that leverages Box2D (a physics engine), OpenGL, and the Ray casting technique to deliver impressive real-time lighting effects. It was featured on AppStore Portugal.

üìö Contributed to StackOverflow for 10 years. Written 984 answers on Swift, iOS, and SpriteKit, which have reached 2.7 million users, earned me a reputation of 57k and a ranking in the top 0.35%.

üåç Since 2016, I have been working remotely with European companies (leveraging Git, GitHub, Slack, and Jira) where I had the opportunity to improve my communication, teamwork, leadership, and problem solving skills.

üìñ Published 11 articles about Swift, Codable, and JSON on Medium.
