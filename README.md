# Luca Angeletti
I am a Software Engineer with 17 years of total experience. Worked on 16 iOS projects (even featured in some Apple Keynotes), have been using Swift for 9 years, and Objective-C for 15 years.

Since 2016, I have been working remotely with companies in Germany, the UK, and Spain (leveraging Git, GitHub, Slack, and Jira) where I could refine my communication, teamwork, and leadership skills.

In 2013, I invested a year in building [Luminetic Land](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvH0Kjk7b8s) , a video game for iPhone and iPad that leverages a physics engine (Box2D), OpenGL, and the RayCasting technique to deliver impressive real-time lighting effects. My game was featured on AppStore Portugal.

I have actively worked at my problem solving skills contributing to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1761687/luca-angeletti) for 10 years. Wrote 984 answers on Swift, iOS, and SpriteKit, which have reached 2.7 million users, earned me a reputation of 57k and ranked me in the top 0.35% of the community.

I have also published 11 articles about Swift, Codable, and JSON on [Medium](https://lucaangeletti.medium.com).
Taught app development in classrooms, via Skype, and on [Codementor](https://codementor.io/lucaangeletti) with a 5-star reputation.
Written [245 tutorials](https://html.it/author/langeletti) in Italian covering topics such as Swift and Objective-C.

Finally, I consider myself a pragmatic software developer with experience in a wide variety of organizations (small startups, big corporates, product companies, and app agencies).
My background includes several paradigms (OOP, POP, Functional, Parallel, Concurrent), architectures (MVC, MVP, MVVM, Redux), and languages (Java, SQL, C, GLSL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS).
